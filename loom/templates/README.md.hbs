Usage
-----

###AMD

If you have AMD modules support in your project, you can use this library like that:

```javascript
define(['path/to/library/{{appName}}'], function({{appName}}){

});
```

###CommonJS

If you have CommonJS support in your project, you can use this library like that:

```javascript
var lib = require('{{appName}}/dist/standalone.js');
```

###Standalone

If you prefere to add the library directly to the HTML page, use it like that:

```html
<script src="path/to/lib/{{appName}}/dist/standalone.js"></script>
```

The library will be available as `window['{{globalName}}']` global variable.

## How to develop the library?

### Initialize

```
git clone path/to/library
npm i
npm i -g bower
bower install
```


### Make a standalone build

[Webpack][1] takes care of creating a [standalone][2] [UMD][3] build. Just run:

```
npm run pack
```

## Run tests

To run a single test use:

```
npm test
```

To run a continous tdd session use:

```
npm run tdd
```

This command will run [karma][4] with [jasmine 2.1][5].

After the test run you will get the **test coverage reports** inside the `/coverage` folder!

The coverage is created by [istanbul][6].

## Bump version

To bump versions in both `bower.json` and `package.json`, you can use [mversion][10].

## CI

Do not forget to add your project to [travis-ci][11] and [coveralls][12]

## Anti-ruining Automated Quality Assurance System

Are you afraid of committing "bad quality" code and ruining everything?
Afraid no more!

This project has a **git hooks integration** (sponsored by [husky][9]), which will run tests and check your javascript **before each commit**.

You are safeguarded against silly mistakes by [jshint][7] and [fixmyjs][8]!

You will not be able to commit the code with:

1. Failing tests
2. Bad javascript code style
